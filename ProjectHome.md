Anyone who at least once lost his project knows – I personally do - how important it is to create backups. Rdiff-backup (http://www.nongnu.org/rdiff-backup/) allows user to incrementally backup one directory into another. Increments make disk usage relatively low, as only differences between two consecutive backups are stored. This has its drawbacks, however. Although user can access files from most recent backup easily, simply by entering the backup directory, it is much harder to access and browse through older versions. Rdiff-backup allows to access them only by set of instructions, that require precise knowledge of file names and backup times. To investigate creation process of certain project one has to invest a lot of time and energy. This reduces rdiff-backup directory to simple copy of a project rather than repository of all its versions.

Possible solution is to create userspace filesystem based on rdiff-backup repository data. As these information are well and explicitly stored, they can be easily accessed by the filesystem and presented to user in clear and friendly manner. Instead of doing a lot typing and bookkeeping, user will be able to freely browse through any revision of the backed up directory.

The easiest – in my opinion – way to create one, is to use FUSE (Filesystem in userspace - http://fuse.sourceforge.net/) library that allows the developer to focus on high level aspects of the filesystem (e.g. Accessing rdiff-back information and files), while it does all the necessary low level work itself. Since using FUSE does not require root privileges it can be used by any user to create personal filesystem on demand.

As soon as filesystem is correctly mounted, it will provide access to snapshot of the repository for every increment that had been done. Directory structure will be the same as the backed up directory at the time of the increment. Any file added to the repository at the will be accessible, yet only the accessed files will be replicated, so disk space usage stays low.

Idea for this filesystem was first presented by **Lukasz Sznuk** from **University of Warsaw** as one of the projects for course in **Operating Systems**.
